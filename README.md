# Trivia-Game-with-vanilla-javascript-and-PHP
Trivia Game written in vanilla (pure) javascript, Ajax and PHP

This is my one millionth update on a trivia game that I have done...not really but it feels like it. LOL
I'm almost there that I can start adding new features to this game, but I still have a few more things I need to add to match the original trivia games that I have done. Once I get that done I will add the new features and write a small tutorial on how to write this game. That's the reason wanted to develop the game strictly using vanilla javascript and not something like JQuery. I feel one can better understand the code better, for in my opinion it makes more sense.
