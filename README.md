Trivia Game written in vanilla (pure) javascript, Ajax and PHP

A Trivia Game that is written in vanilla (pure)Javascript that DOES NOT use a library like jQuery. It pulls in questions and answers using Ajax and PHP (server side language). I am basically wrapping up developing the heart of this game and once I am finished with that, I will be adding addition features to the game. Some of the features include the ability to select categories, number of questions per game and the difficulty level of the the game. I also want to add the ability to add qeustions/answers to the database table via the user's web browser, so everyone can add his/her own questions. There will be the ability to edit the questions and answers as well. 

I also hope to write a tutorial on how to develop this game and post the tutorial on my main website: https://www.pepster.com.
